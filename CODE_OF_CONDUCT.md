# Code of Conduct

## Overview

The Awesome ML Privacy Mitigation project is committed to creating a welcoming environment for all contributors. We value diverse perspectives and respectful collaboration, especially given the sensitive nature of privacy research.

## Privacy Research Ethics

As a repository focused on ML privacy techniques, we have specific ethical requirements:

- **Educational Focus**: Discussions of privacy attacks must be presented in an educational context with an emphasis on defense mechanisms
- **Privacy-First Mindset**: Contributions should advance privacy protection, not demonstrate how to circumvent privacy
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities in privacy systems privately to maintainers before public disclosure
- **Data Responsibility**: Example datasets must be properly anonymized or synthetic
- **Explicitness About Limitations**: All techniques must have clear documentation about their privacy-utility tradeoffs

## Expected Behavior

- Maintain a professional, inclusive, and respectful communication style
- Provide constructive feedback focused on technical content
- Credit others' work appropriately through proper citations
- Be open to diverse viewpoints and implementation approaches

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Sharing techniques specifically designed to bypass or subvert privacy protections
- Harassment or discrimination of any kind
- Sharing private or confidential information without permission
- Aggressive or disrespectful comments toward other contributors

## Enforcement

Project maintainers will enforce this code through:
- Removal of inappropriate content
- Temporary or permanent bans for severe violations
- Private warnings for minor issues
